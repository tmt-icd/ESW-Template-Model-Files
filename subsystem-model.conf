This folder documents the required APIs provided by __Executive Software__ for use in other subsystems to ensure compatability.
(TMT.DEOPS.OSW.ESW). The Executive Software (ESW) subsystem includes the software tools necessary for efficient TMT operations.
Specifically, the ESW contains the master system sequencer, which enables synchronized operation of all TMT subsystems.
ESW includes user interfaces for control and monitoring of TMT subsystems and overall environmental conditions.
This subsystem enables the execution of observations (both classical and queue) for on-site and remote observers.
