The template-ocs-sequencer is a template OCS Master Sequencer that is demonstrating the required commands and events received and sent.
The idea is that these events and commands will be copied from these files into the files of the subsystem.
These model files will be updated based on the evolution of the ESW design and input from stakeholders.
